        <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African
            bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant
            (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea;
            extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis
            called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is
            prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the
            incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist
            in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears
            and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

        <main>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.
